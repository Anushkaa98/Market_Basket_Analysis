# Market Basket Analysis

## Overview
This repository hosts an R-based project designed to conduct Market Basket Analysis using detailed transactional data. The project aims to reveal associations and patterns between different products purchased together, helping businesses understand customer purchase behavior for better marketing and sales strategies.

## Key Features
- **Data Preparation**: Cleansing and preprocessing data to ensure quality and consistency.
- **Association Rules Mining**: Leveraging the `arules` package to discover interesting relationships between items.
- **Visualization**: Utilizing `ggplot2` and `arulesViz` for graphical representation of item frequencies and association rules.

## Technologies Used
- R
- R Libraries: `arules`, `arulesViz`, `tidyverse`, `readxl`, `knitr`, `ggplot2`, `lubridate`, `dplyr`

## How It Works
1. **Data Loading**: The script starts by importing data from an Excel file.
2. **Data Cleaning**: Includes removing incomplete records and converting necessary fields.
3. **Rule Generation**: Implements the Apriori algorithm to generate and filter association rules.
4. **Visualization**: Outputs visual insights into item relationships and frequencies.

## Setup and Installation
Ensure R is installed on your system along with the following packages. Run these commands in R to install the necessary packages:
```R
install.packages(c("arules", "arulesViz", "tidyverse", "readxl", "knitr", "ggplot2", "lubridate", "dplyr"))
